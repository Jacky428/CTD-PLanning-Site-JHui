<h2>Final choice for website making </h2>
<p>Elementry P.E and Health Department Websit
   Mr.Kalin, the elementry school PE teacher designed a website. However, due to
  the limation of time and skill, Mr.Kalin was not able to create a desirable website. As a result, Trisha, Archit, and I are planning to redesign the school elementry P.E and Health Department to enhance more parents and students to have a more understanding of this subject.
</p>
<ul>Project Objectives</ul>
<li>To improve the user experience of the current website </li>
<li>For parents and students to easily access supporting materials related to PE in elementary school </li>
<li>For parents to better understand P.E in elementary school </li>
<li>For Mr.Kalin to easily update the site in future</Li>
