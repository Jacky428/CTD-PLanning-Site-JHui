<h2> <strong> <span style="color: #0000ff;"> Final choice for website making </span> </strong> </h2>
<p> <span style="color: #D2691E;"> Elementry P.E and Health Department Websit
   Mr.Kalin, the elementry school PE teacher designed a website. However, due to
  the limation of time and skill, Mr.Kalin was not able to create a desirable website. As a result, Trisha, Archit, and I are planning to redesign the school elementry P.E and Health Department to enhance more parents and students to have a more understanding of this subject.</span></p>


<a href="https://sites.google.com/a/ais.edu.hk/physical-education-health/"> Here is the website that Mr.Kalin originally created </a> <P>We are using this as a refernce to modify and recreate a new Google Site. </P>
</p>

<h3><strong> <span style="color: #FF1493;">Project Objectives </span></h3>

<li>To improve the user experience of the current website </li>
<li>For parents and students to easily access supporting materials related to PE in elementary school </li>
<li>For parents to better understand P.E in elementary school </li>
<li>For Mr.Kalin to easily update the site in future</Li>

<h3><strong> <span style="color: #FF1493;" > Success Criteria </span> </h3>

<li>Mr.Kalin is successfully able to view the final product, from that he could use it and update informations at the end. </li>
<li>Mr.Kalin is satisfied with the site </li>
<li>A home page that catches attention </li>
<li>A health-home resource page that could guide and provide the parents and students infromation for home exercise.
<h4><strong> <span style="color: #FF4500;"> Questions to Consider for Planning Site</span> </h4>

  <p>Who will be the audience for your website? </P>
  <p>Teachers and students from the elementry school are both the audience for this website. By creating this site, parents could constantly be in touch with the school's activities and students progress of this course. The site is easily accessible so it is convenient for parents to receive references for this course. For my home health resource page, I have included informations about participating fitness and sports outdside of P.E class. </p>

  <P> What will be the specific purpose of your website? </p>
  <p> The specifc purpose of my webpage is to encourage parents and students to particpate in sports anf fitness outside of P.E classroom. As an hour of P.E class is not enough time for the students to mantain or improve their fitness level. As a lot of sutdents are expercing lack of sports and exercise nowadays. Students focus too much time on studying or gaming, I beleive studnets should particpaite in sports after school as a healthy well-rounded lifestyle. As being a well-rounded individual is part of a catergory of ESLRs, a well-rounded individual is a person that leads an active, balance, and healthy lifestyle; a student shoul not only be focusing on gaming or studying, instead parents should encoruage students to spend time on doing exercise outside school.

  <p>Who is the client? (Whose problem will creating this website solve? Who would be willing to pay for this website?)</p>
  <p> The client of this website project is Mr.Kalin, the P.E teacher of elementry school. Mr.Kalin requested us for a re-design of his Elementry P.E website on Google Site, he is not pleased with the structure and layout of the webpage as he himself is not an expert of website designing. He pointed out the weakness of his site as the home page is not organized, pictures and videos are all over the place. The color and decoration is also not pleasant and there are a lot of useless junk pages in it such as page with blank infornations or pictures only. Another problem we face would be design the website on a Google Site page instead of creatin an actual website with HTML or CSS. Google Site does not allow a lot of HTML or CSS strcuture on it, so it will limit our design and decoration of the webpage. Also our group need to make sure that Mr.Kalin is able to edit the site after we finihsed creating it, as we assumed Mr.Kalin would be continuing on adding and updating imformations on the site.



  <p>Identify the content and major categories and sub-categories for your website.</p >
  <p>Prioritize the content. How will it be organised? What is most important for the audience / purpose? </p>
