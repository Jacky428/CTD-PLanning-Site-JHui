<h2>Final choice for website making </h2>
<p>Elementry P.E and Health Department Websit
   Mr.Kalin, the elementry school PE teacher designed a website. However, due to
  the limation of time and skill, Mr.Kalin was not able to create a desirable website. As a result, Trisha, Archit, and I are planning to redesign the school elementry P.E and Health Department to enhance more parents and students to have a more understanding of this subject.


<a href="https://sites.google.com/a/ais.edu.hk/physical-education-health/"> Here is the website that Mr.Kalin created </a>
