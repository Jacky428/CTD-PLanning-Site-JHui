  <h1>How my planning site was created</h1>
  <p> I have created my planning site storyboard with two different applications which are Firework and Dreamweaver. I am going to discuss the strength and weakness of using Fireworks and Dreamweaver. </P>

  <h2> What is Firework? What is Dreamweaver? </h2>
  <p>Adobe Dreamweaver and Fireworks software are both commonly used by web-designers and developers around the world. However, each program is only available to a standardize level; both of them have different strength and benefit but they do contain problems and weaknesses for the users. Both of the programs are available for the Microsoft Windows and Mac OS x operating system. </P>
  <p> Adobe Dreamweaver is a web development tool used to build websites and applications with mostly programming code, such as the most common HTML and CSS.  Dreamweaver also provides a special feature that what you see is what you get; once you type out your code, you will automatically see the design and layout of your webpage. Also, Dreamweaver contains features such as the ability to manage uploading of site files in one application,  to create the structure of the layout right after you create your code, and the integration with  CMS (content management system, a system used to mange the content of a web site) such as WordPress. </P>
  <p>Adobe Firework is a graphics application intended for a very broad of usage, from entertainment such as designing poster to actual business such as designing name card. We could use Firework to optimize images, create digital images, and webpages too. Firework shares similar functions with Photoshop such as the editing of pictures and images. Firework allows the function of interactive Web prototype, by exporting the webpage you created as a HTML, CSS or image; you can send the prototype to client for reference and approval. </P>


  <h2> Planning Site I Made </h2>
  <p>
    <a href="javascripts/storyboard of planning site Jacky Hui.htm" > Fireworks version</a></li>

    <h3> The strength of using Firework </h3>
      <li>Firework allows you to create a brief working draft.</li>
      <li>Firework allows you to construct layouts for publications, organize large number of text blocks and images.</li>
      <li>Firework allows you to create images with quick handy vector tools. </li>
      <li>Fireworks provide design with pixel perfect accuracy, Fireworks allow you to control the exact number of pixels and axis coordination you prefer in your design.</li>
      <li> Fireworks allow you to build a full-working functional website. You can create buttons, navigation bars, hotspots and rollover, from the program. You can use slice tools to customized your webpage. </li>
      <li>Fireworks allow you to design quick gradients, it is much easier than creating gradients in Photoshop or Dreamweaver. </li>

    <h3>The weakness of using Firework </h3>
    <li>Fireworks would experience slow performance when counters with large file image size. </li>
    <li>Fireworks does not allow immediate view of your designed webpage. </li>
    <li>Fireworks have limited filters, layer styles and effects. </li>
    <li>Fireworks require practice to gain perfection in vector tools </li>


    <p> <a href="javascripts/planning site DW.html" > Dreamweaver version </a> </p>
    <h3> The stregth of using Dreamweaver </h3>
      <li>Dreamweaver helps time saving as it will have code suggestion. As you type a HTML tag, it will list all the available tags that allow you to key the first letter of a tag then select the desired tag from the list. </li>
      <li>Dreamweaver provides the function of a template site. Eventually you will want to start making bigger and bigger sites. It will be very annoying to add the same template to each webpage. So by creating one page that has the overall layout and functionality across your site, you can turn it into a template. </li>
      <li>Dreamweaver allows easy tab and files selection. As you are creating a prototype, it will eventually cause you to open more pages. But Dreamweaver contains easy method of selecting tab and file selection, as it became much easier to tab through files you are currently working on. This is very useful when referencing other pages or moving content from one place to another </li>

    <h3> The weakness of using Firework   </h3>
    <li> Dreamweaver displays confusing interface. At the very top of DW there are 15 items to press, ranging form menu items to quick interface changes.  Secondly there are 5-50 options and function (depends on how many files you have open) and on the third tier there are even mores.</li>
    <li>Dreamweaver does not allow the arrangement of word and text. If you insert texts inside a box, it does not allow you to arrange the text to the center. </li>
     <li>Dreamweaver makes web designers lazy. As people would only rely on the Dreamweaverâ€™s function of automatically typing the code itself, people would slowly forget how to code and create a web site. Although it might seem as a very advanced and convenient applications, it will slowly make us less sophisticated with coding.</li>
